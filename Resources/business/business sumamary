overview

To this day, approximately half of the global population still lives on the equivalent of $2 a day.
More often than not, these low paying jobs do not guarantee stability and individuals can readily be replaced by others seeking work. Workers are then forced to perform through illnesses, unsafe working conditions, and long hours at risk of losing their job if they miss even a shift
Over 60% of all workers do not have any form of employment contract and less than 45% of wage and salary workers are full-time, permanent employees.
Over the past 25 years, despite numerous instances of political unrest, famine, and recession, the global workforce has seen significant improvements in the number of people living in global poverty. In economic and infrastructural developing countries, 34% of workers are now considered middle class, which almost tripled between 1991-2015. While this shift is promising, we are at a critical point where there is beginning to be slower growth, widening inequalities due to climate change, and not enough quality jobs to meet the demand. The period of 2010-2018 saw a 2.0% per capita GDP growth rate, which declined to 1.5% in 2019 pre pandemic.COVID-19 AND SDG 8
