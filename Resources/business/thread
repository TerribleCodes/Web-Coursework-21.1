COVID-19 AND SDG 8
COVID-19 had an immediate impact on economies worldwide with the most devastating impact on developing countries.
There was an estimated 4.2% decrease in global GDP per capita in 2020. Informal economy workers, those who partake in enterprises, jobs, and trades that are not protected by the state became incredibly vulnerable to losing their livelihoods. Throughout the pandemic, an estimated 1.6 billion informal economy workers lost their source of income. The tourism industry was of the industries that suffered the greatest impacts. With no one traveling, hotels, destination islands, travel planners, tour operators, souvenir shops, and numerous other niche tourism workers lost their main source of income. This highlighted how heavily billions of people rely on tourism and the need for consistent, reliable, diversified sources of income.
