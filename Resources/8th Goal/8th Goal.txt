What the heck is Sustainable Development Goal 8?
	For close to three decades, the number of workers living in extreme poverty has reduced drastically.
This is despite the lasting impact of the 2008 economic crisis and global recession. <http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/global-financial-crisis-2008-10?utm_source=EN&utm_medium=GSR&utm_content=US_UNDP_PaidSearch_Brand_English&utm_campaign=CENTRAL&c_src=CENTRAL&c_src2=GSR&gclid=CjwKCAiA24SPBhB0EiwAjBgkhnElcPLOkJDEVVH4tWmBPAe7XUKCR0FfKxAlawb4ZTZ8gKWkgfhwgRoCryAQAvD_BwE>
In developing countries, 34% of total employments were for the middle class,
a number that has increased rapidly between 1991 and 2015. In spite of that, the global economy continues to recover; the world is seeing slower growth, inequalities widened,
and low level of jobs opportunity that is not commensurate of the labor force.
Employment growth since 2008 has averaged only 0.1% annually, compared with 0.9% between 2000 and 2007. Over 60 per cent of all workers do not have an employment contract.
SDG 8 aims at fostering sustainable and equitable economic growth for all workers, irrespective of their background, race or gender.
This means achieving “higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation,
including through a focus on high-value added and labor - intensive sectors.”
Sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve living standards.

Sustainable Development Goal 8 today:
COVID-19 has disrupted billions of lives and endangered the global economy.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects a global recession as bad as or worse than in 2009.
As job losses escalate, the International Labor Organization estimates that nearly half of the global workforce is at risk of losing their livelihoods.
Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, one in five countries – home to billions of people living in poverty – were likely to see per capita incomes stagnate or decline in 2020.
Now, the economic and financial shocks associated with COVID-19—such as disruptions to industrial production, falling commodity prices,
financial market volatility, and rising insecurity—are derailing the already tepid economic growth and compounding heightened risks from other factors.
